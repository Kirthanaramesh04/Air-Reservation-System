The Air Reservation System is designed to streamline and automate the flight booking process using Python and MongoDB. By integrating these technologies, the system allows for efficient management of customer data, flight schedules, reservations, and payments. With a focus on user-friendly data handling, it provides a secure and organized way to handle bookings, helping airlines and travel agencies reduce manual effort and errors.
The main goal of this project is to automate and simplify the air reservation process, enabling users to book flights, store customer information, and manage reservations in a database. This system enhances the overall efficiency of the booking process and ensures data security through MongoDB integration.
The Air Reservation System can be used by airlines or travel agencies to:
     -Collect and store customer information.
     -Provide flight schedules, availability, and prices.
     -Manage seat reservations and handle payments.
 Output of the project:  The system stores data such as customer details, flight information, seat reservations, and payment records. Here's an example of the output stored in MongoDB:
     *Customer Details: Name, Address, Contact, City, State, Country, Email, and Customer ID.
     *Flight Information: Flight Number, Flight Name, Departure and Arrival Times, Origin, and 
      Destination.
     *Booking Details: Class, Number of Seats, Total Price.
     *Payment Details: Payment Type (e.g., Credit Card,Google Pay,..).

     
This project provides a scalable solution for managing flight bookings efficiently.
